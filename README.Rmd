# LRDemo

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of LRDemo is to implement a binary or multinomial logistic regression via gradient descent. Helper functions are carried out in C++/ Rcpp for optimized computation. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of LRDemo like so:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/LRDemo")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(LRDemo)

set.seed(1234567)
x <- matrix(rnorm(200), ncol = 2)
p <- 1 / (1 + exp(-(x[, 1] - x[, 2])))
y <- rbinom(nrow(x), size = 1, prob = p)

fit  <- logRegModel(x, y, family = "binomial", nIter = 500)
phat <- predict(fit, x, type = "response")
mean((phat > 0.5) == y)

```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
